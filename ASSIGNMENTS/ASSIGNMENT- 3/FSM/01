1. Design a finite state machine that has an input x and output y. The output should
be asserted whenever x = 1 or x = 0 for three consecutive clock pulses. In other
words, the FSM should detect the sequences 111 or 000. Overlapping sequences
are allowed, so a sequence of four or five 0s or 1s should also output 1.

ANSWER : 

module mealay_111( 
    input in,
    input clk,
    input rst,
    output out
);

    parameter a = 3'd1;
    parameter b = 3'd2;
    parameter c = 3'd3;

    reg [2:0] state, next_state;
    reg y;

    assign out = y;


    always @(posedge clk or negedge rst) begin
        if (!rst)
            state <= a;
        else
            state <= next_state;
    end

    always @(*) begin
        case (state)
            a: next_state = in ? b : a;
            b: next_state = in ? c : a;
            c: next_state = in ? b : a;
            default: next_state = a;
        endcase
    end

    always @(*) begin
        y = (state == c && in == 1);
    end

endmodule
